  [BUILD FIX]

    * t/lexicals.t depended upon "use strict" being propagated into
      the quoted subs environment.  This seems not to be the case in
      Perl < 5.22

  [DISTRIBUTION FIX]

    * distribution inadvertently contained a debug version of Sub::Quote
    * requires Sub::Quote version 2.002002 for sanitize_identifier

0.02      2016-12-16 17:23:01-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * quote_subs ensures that Sub::Quote::quote_sub gets the correct
      compile context and subroutine package.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

    * quote_subs can now inline syntactically incomplete code
      snippets.
